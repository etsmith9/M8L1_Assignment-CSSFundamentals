        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <h3> Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
